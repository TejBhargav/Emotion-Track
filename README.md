"EmotionTrack: Enhancing Employee Emotional Wellbeing through Insightful Monitoring"


 This innovative project seamlessly integrates with keylogger with sentiment analysis technology for employee wellbeing, enabling the real time capture and analysis of keystrokes to uncover the emotional context behind every interaction of employees.

The integration of keyloggers and sentiment analysis provides a comprehensive method for monitoring employees, enhancing productivity, security, and well-being. Keyloggers record keystrokes, offering insights into employee activities, while sentiment analysis interprets attitudes and emotions. This combination enables organizations to detect patterns, identify potential security risks, optimize workflows, and measure employee satisfaction. Despite its benefits, this approach raises privacy, trust, and ethical issues. By ensuring transparent communication, obtaining informed consent, implementing data security measures, providing employee education, and maintaining a balanced monitoring approach, organizations can utilize this technology effectively while respecting employee privacy and rights.The insights gathered from EmotionTrack can be used by organizations to identify patterns, detect potential emotional distress or dissatisfaction among employees, and implement targeted interventions to address these issues.EmotionTrack offers a hopeful way to support employee wellbeing by closely monitoring emotions. This can lead to higher productivity, happier employees, and better success for the company.
